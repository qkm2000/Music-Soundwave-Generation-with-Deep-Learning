# Music Soundwave Generation with Deep Learning

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of recognizing and classifying various types of landscapes and earcons. The primary focus is on leveraging deep learning techniques to generate Earcons that convey more emotional and contextual information than traditional Earcons. By utilizing state-of-the-art libraries such as PyTorch, this project provides a comprehensive framework for training, evaluating, and deploying models in a reproducible manner.

The datasets used in this project include a diverse collection of landscape images and earcons, ensuring that the model can generalize well across different environments and soundscapes. The ultimate goal is to create a robust system that can be applied in various real-world applications such as creating Earcons for computer operating systems or for use in the transport and healthcare industries.

## Installation

It is highly recommended that you install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and use that as your environment manager

1. Create an environment with `conda create -n [NAME] python=3.11`
2. run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Once your environment is set up, run `pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124`
4. Run [test.ipynb](/FYP/notebooks/test.ipynb) and make sure that it completes to make sure that your environment is set up properly

## Data

There is only 1 Earcon dataset at the moment, and you can get it [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/semantic_differential_sound_database/25102763/5)

There are 3 image datasets at the moment, the data can be found in the following links:
* [Landscape1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshsaxenadn/landscape-recognition-image-dataset-12k-images)
* [Landscape2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnaud58/landscape-pictures)
